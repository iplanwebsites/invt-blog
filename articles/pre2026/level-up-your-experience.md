Any social website has its learning curve. You discover the most basic features, then, later on, find the exclusive ones that make that platform unique. TikTok has short yet engaging videos. Instagram has those eye-catching images. Reddit gives you threads where there are a lot of discussions involved.

No matter what the website, there’s a feature that would stand out. The same goes for Invitation. We’re a community rich in referral sharing. Find referral bonuses here, and get sign-up bonuses there. With the launch of V2, there are more features to use that aim to give you what you need in referral marketing.

With all these features and insights, how can you make your experience better? Whether you’re new to this site or have been using it for quite a while, we’ve made this article just for you. Today, we’ll discuss some tips that will be helpful in your journey as a user on Invitation. Here’s what we’ll talk about:

You might have read some of our tips from previous articles, but this one’s going to be more detailed and would apply to any situation on your account.

### In-depth profile customization

Yeah, it’s good that you’ve set up your username, display name, and bio. But does it stop there? Have you really reviewed your profile after just setting it up? Profile customization goes a long way. Social websites strongly favor first impressions. Let’s do a quick check.

How’s your username? People should be able to get a glimpse of your character or profile just by setting up your username. For example, the @support team. Just by our username, you can get the gist that we’re here to help anyone. If that wasn’t enough, our page’s display name shows “Support team”.&nbsp;

Your bio is something that could be more helpful than you can imagine. What made you join the website? Do you have a story to share about yourself? It’s the small details that people can find relatable, and if they can find something like that in your profile, you’ll get your first engagement on Invitation sooner than you might think.

Now that you’ve edited your info, it’s time to think about your referral links and codes. Don’t just post anything that you already have. Chances are, others already have signed up for them. There are 5,000 apps and sites you’ll find on Invitation, check them out and you’ll definitely find new ones worth sharing. It starts with what you have, then grows into those that other users might haven’t discovered.

Imagine this, you have a Coinbase link but more users might have already signed up for it. It’s still worth sharing, but what if you posted another link to a similar app like Bitmart? There’s the famous Coinbase, but more users would sign up for Bitmart if they haven’t heard of it. They’re both crypto exchanges and nothing’s stopping you from having links from both too.&nbsp;

### Finding the right matches

A painting can be made out of a thousand colors. It’s impossible to think that your interests are just one thing. If you like banking apps, you can also like food delivery apps. That’s how you can exchange referrals with more users. You have to widen your scope of interest.

Think of your Invitation profile like Instagram. Since you have 3 posts per row, you can post a row of banking apps, a different row for food delivery apps, then for some gaming sites. That’s 3 interests that you can explore together with other users on Invitation. You’d find a banking enthusiast, a foodie, and a gamer. It can be one person or even better, 3 other users to be friends with!

The right matches give you the chance to exchange referrals with them. It’s easier to share referrals with someone you’re familiar with than with someone who you haven’t talked with before. Once you’ve found someone who has similar interests, you can chat with them using the website inbox. It’s building a connection and expanding your network at its finest.

### Contributing to the community

Wouldn’t you agree that it’s easier to chat with someone who seems approachable? If you try to find other active users on Invitation, you’ll see that some of them are really helpful and can give you the answers you need. If you think you can set an example too, then you can start doing it right away.

For example, if you’re well-informed about fashion sites that give discounts, you can share on the discussions page that there’s a limited sale for a particular store. If you have a referral link from that same store, the better. You’ll be able to guide other users on the sign-up process, and casually give them your referral link to get them started.

You would notice that Invitation is a positive and active community. It’s because of the people. There are lots of users that care enough to reply on the discussions page, and also in the website inbox.

These tips are written in a way that applies to everybody. Whether you just joined or have been a user for more than a year, these ideas would get you a visibility boost. We’re happy to discuss more in chat too. So feel free to message us if you have any questions. See you in the next guide!
