### Putting referral marketing forward

We're supporting this thriving community by building tools and organizing resources that help people save money and earn online. We’re a tech startup trying to fix referral marketing. Invitation’s community believes that referrals are the future of digital marketing.

### A continuously growing community

Today, over 250,000 mini influencers earn by promoting products they love on Invitation. They’re regular people looking for deals and sharing their referrals with their friends.

For brands or businesses, referral campaigns are a great channel that usually have better ROI than advertising with Google or Meta.

### Building the future of marketing

Invitation continues to build the biggest referral program database. We’re partnering with thousands of merchants, and we provide handy tools to our users. We're a small and independent company so when you purchase a pro plan it really helps us allocate more resources. Furthermore, we're growing fast and have exciting plans coming up!

We have two main consumer products: an online community and a browser extension.
