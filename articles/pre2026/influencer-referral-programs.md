Most influencers grow based on their social reach. The more followers you have, the more deals you could possibly get. It's a tough competition on the internet, because as Invitation believes, everyone can be an influencer. Most start small and end up being big quickly.

### **Influence is a responsibility**

Since influence can put food on the table nowadays, it must be considered as a responsibility. Most people try to earn a living being an influencer, and there are lots of ways to do that. It's not how famous you become, but how you can help others get to where you are. In return, you can get rewarded for it, and you can actually get more bonuses.

### **Invite wisely**

There are referral programs for influencer apps and sites too. If you use your reach to participate in referral programs, the rewards are massive. It's hitting two birds with one stone. You invite people and help them get sign-up bonuses, then you get rewarded with various perks which helps you grow your reach. Here's a great list of influencer platforms that you can try right away. Try Invitation too, and you can grow your following more quickly!
