At Invitation, we enjoy discovering marketing innovations and business tips, no matter what kind of user you are. This article is specifically for those in the E-commerce industry. Whether you’re a start-up or a seasoned one, you’ll find this article relevant and interesting.

If you have an e-commerce business, you’ll want to prepare for the upcoming trends as best and quickly as possible. Our tips work for businesses of all sizes and offer actionable tricks you can use to increase your revenue.&nbsp;

E-commerce is a fast-paced industry, and we’re aware of the fact that a lot of sales strategies will get called trends and will never take off. With that in mind, we collected 4 trends that are only bound to get bigger.&nbsp;

From mobile-friendly webshops to voice search and more, this piece of content on [e-commerce](https://betterproposals.io/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-building-a-winning-proposal-for-e-commerce-businesses/) will give you a wider picture of market demands.&nbsp;

## **Mobile e-commerce**

Every year we see [an increase](https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/mobile-commerce/) in the number of purchases made on mobile devices, so it’s a safe bet to expect an even bigger increase this year. To really get into it, we need to explain the difference between desktop and mobile e-commerce.

Mobile is a natural progression of e-commerce. That means that a lot of webshops have a mobile version. However, that doesn’t equate to mobile e-commerce. Webshops that can be accessed via smartphone but aren’t optimized for different devices can turn customers away rather than making them purchase. Creating a seamless mobile experience goes a long way towards securing more purchases.

With all that being said, you should work towards making your page mobile-friendly. Firstly, test your page with Google’s Mobile-Friendly Test. It will list all the issues your page may have, giving you an idea of where to start.&nbsp;

Another way to do that is by creating a [progressive web app](https://blog.shift4shop.com/future-of-ecommerce-2021) (PWA). PWAs were created in order to allow customers to view pages they have previously browsed without internet access. They can be built in less time and are very easy to manage.&nbsp;

They are better than regular apps because they can be used instantly, without the need to install them. Moreover, native apps have up to [3 times more](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/08/a-beginners-guide-to-progressive-web-apps/) retention than PWAs. That means that a customer is more likely to shop again.

## **Environmental sustainability**

With the rise of social media, corporate social responsibility became more and more transparent, leading to new ways of brands proving they care about more than just money. If you want to become more open about your efforts to lead a sustainable business, you’re going to have to create a strategy to go about it.

Before you go announcing your new goals and [vision on social media](https://www.kontentino.com/blog/4-social-media-trends-for-2021/), work on your production, packaging, your carbon emission, your recycling habits, and the sustainability of your products. Remember, this is a long-term goal, and you’ll have to work on it constantly to achieve the numbers other brands have (like going plastic-free in a few years).

The importance of this strategy, besides preserving our environment, is the fact that your brand’s stance on the topic of environmental sustainability may be a deciding factor in a [customers’ purchasing journey](https://www.mediatoolkit.com/blog/5-types-of-customer-service-software-that-enhance-support-quality/).

Once you create your strategy, share it with your audience and make them a part of the story by showing them how their purchase fits into the larger picture of your brand’s sustainability. You can offer them badges or AI-generated visuals they can share on social media which will lead to a higher engagement rate.&nbsp;

## **Voice search**&nbsp;

With researchers predicting that voice commerce will reach an amazing [$40 billion by 2022](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/04/10/voice-search-statistics-2018#:~:text=Voice%20Commerce%20Statistics&text=They're%20predicted%20to%20reach,their%20devices%2C%20per%20Edison%20Research.&text=5%25%20of%20consumers%20use%20voice,%25%20by%202022%2C%20per%20MoffettNathanson.), this platform can no longer be ignored. Having it be so convenient to order products with virtual assistants, the voice search trend will only go up from here.

In order to reap the benefits of voice commerce, you’ll have to optimize your content, as well as your [sales pipeline](https://www.cloudtalk.io/outbound-sales). The thing you have to realize is that people don’t talk in the same manner they write when looking up things on web browsers.&nbsp;

The way people interact with their virtual assistants is by giving commands, or by asking questions. That is why you have to incorporate answers to the most common questions in your sales funnel.&nbsp;

If you’re selling brownie pans, instead of only covering the question “Where can I buy brownie pans?”, think about expanding to questions like “What is the best brownie recipe?”, “How to make the best brownies?” etc.&nbsp;

You really need to think outside the box when working on incorporating voice search in your sales funnel and think about different situations in which your audience can find themselves.&nbsp;

Other than that, work on your site’s voice navigation for a true “hands-free” experience.&nbsp;

## **New payment options**

Offering different payment methods has gone beyond integrations like Google Pay or PayPal and now includes an array of cryptocurrencies. They are a lot more convenient for your clients, and to circle back, they produce less paper which in turn leads to minimizing your carbon footprint.&nbsp;

When it comes to payment options, you’ll want to rely on the law of large numbers and go for as many options as possible. This strategy will [increase your revenue](https://www.pointcheckout.com/en/blog/jj24rk/how-can-diverse-payment-options-benefit-customers-and), especially if they can finalize their purchase without waiting for bank approval.

Another benefit of various payment options is that they work worldwide, while certain credit and debit cards are only available in a limited number of countries. Also, some payment options allow you to pay later, which makes it easier for your clients to keep track of their budgets.

If you want to promote your payment options, make sure to emphasize the security aspect of options like digital wallets. They don’t store your personal information, like credit card details and by using them you are less likely to fall victim to a scam.&nbsp;&nbsp;

## **In conclusion**

The key aspect of successful e-commerce trends are long-term benefits, providing customers with a better shopping experience and working towards being more transparent about data protection, sustainability and such.

If you keep working towards [bettering your business](http://www.workast.com) while keeping your client’s needs and wants in mind and educating them along the way about the benefits of your tools and strategies, you’ll keep growing.&nbsp;

In the end, it’s important to figure out what works best for your brand and how you can make the most of your current webshop.&nbsp;
