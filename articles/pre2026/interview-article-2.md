Who doesn't love life hacks? They make our daily lives more convenient and fun. The evolution of the internet has made it possible for people to take advantage of more deals. This interview with another loyal Invitation user is something that you'll definitely relate to. Read ahead as John Mego (@johnmego) shares his amazing experience of finding the best deals online day by day!

## **How did you get into this?**

I've been an online deal hunter for over 15 years. At the time I started my journey, I was attending community college and working part-time to make ends meet. In 2006, I stumbled upon Fatwallet.com, a forum where people shared information on anything and everything related to deals, sweepstakes, freebies, etc. Thanks to this site and similar sites, I was able to score everything from free merchandise, modest discounts, to insane deals. A top-of-the-line washer and dryer that retails for over $3,000 is on sale for $600 total? Yes please! Sign up for a bank account and get $500 for doing so? Sign me up! As the years went on, I started noticing that many of these online retailers and services I use have "refer-a-friend" programs where I could make some extra money by sharing my link to others. I initially shared only one or two with select friends and family. Then one day last year, I asked myself if there might be a better way to do it. That's when I searched online and found Invitation.Codes. Invitation was everything I was looking for and more. Once I set up a profile, I gathered all the referral links available to me from sites, products, and services I use, and the rest was history!

## **What do you like most about affiliate/referral marketing?**

The thing that I like the most is that affiliate/referral marketing greatly benefits both parties. For many of these sites and services, you might not receive any bonus if you were to sign up. But, if you sign up using a referral link, you do get a bonus, and the person who referred you also gets one! Once you've signed up, you get your own referral link that you can share with others to earn even more rewards. It's a win-win all around!

## **What's your angle to it?**

I am a customer of every single site, product, service, or app I refer. I believe in the products. Furthermore, I use the service, and I don't just sign up for the sake of signing up or having more referrals. Every site I've listed a referral link to is a site that has a great sign-up bonus and/or deal that makes it worth signing up for.

## **Does it feed to your other occupation (YouTuber, freelancer, etc)?**

Referral links in and of themselves haven't directly fed to my day job. That said, I do consider affiliate/referral marketing to be a job in and of itself. For instance, keeping on top of all my referral links/info, checking them monthly to ensure the links and bonuses/terms are still current as they often change. Answering any questions when someone messages me on how any of it works, etc. Not to mention, I'm still always looking for great sites offering great sign-up bonuses and value.

I can say that my 15 years of deal hunting made me who I am today, and it has taught me so many valuable lessons that I use to this day, including:

The importance of research

Time is money

The courage to ask for something you want. (The worst they can say is, "no". If you don't ask, then you're saying "no" for them).

## **What would you say to someone who is just starting out to help them?**

Research. Check each of the sites and apps you frequent to see if any of them have referral programs that you could share with others. Since you're already here on Invitation, check out the list of deals of over 1,000 sites. You'll likely find that you belong to some sites (which means that the site has a referral link or code you can share), and you may just find some great new sites and services that you'll benefit from joining, while also benefiting other members!

## **How do you use Invitation, and what benefits did it bring you?**

I use Invitation to share my referral links to sites, services, and apps that I frequent. It brought me some extra money, discounts, etc. I also make sure that Invitation is my first stop when I'm about to sign up for a new website, to see if there's a referral link I could be using to do so. Most recently, I used referral links that others posted on Invitation for eToro, iConsumer and RebatesMe.

## **What is your favorite feature?**

I really like the social and community aspect of Invitation. I've seen sites where you simply post your referral links and that's basically all the site offers. The ability to comment on each other's deals, follow them, see all of their deals and activity, message them, create discussions about a specific deal, the social and community features really make Invitation not just an affiliate/referral marketing site, but something really special that I find myself coming back to daily.

## **Any words of caution to newcomers?**

Make sure you're in this because you want to help others thrive while also helping yourself thrive. Be honest as you list the bonuses and terms of any and all referrals. If a site is offering a $5 bonus, don't list it as $50 in the hopes of duping people into using your link. If you take the approach of trying to find a sucker, you'll likely find the sucker is you in the end.

That was an engaging interview. Indeed, learning life hacks is more fun with other people, combined with the integrity and honesty that helps you grow together. This interview shows that you don't have to be shady to be successful in something, you'll find the best deals as long as work hard and help others too!
