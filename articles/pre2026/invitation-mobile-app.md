Every social media platform has one common goal, which is accessibility. If you can use your social media account on a desktop, it's given that you should also be able to use it on your phone. However, social media apps made for websites are sometimes not compatible to use on your mobile device. We always think about this, as more and more people ask for a mobile version of Invitation.

### **Access your referrals anytime and anywhere**

Imagine, your personal profile full of your referral codes and links being accessible with a single click. The convenience of tracking your progress and reaching out to fellow users has been made easier. Invitation will launch a mobile app soon, which is the same as the platform that you've been on using your desktop, but now, optimized for mobile use! Here are some features that you could expect to come soon:

Personal Profile Page

The Community

Invitation Coins

Referral Programs List

Pro Plans

If you're a regular user on the website, you will soon notice that all your favorite features will be available on Android and iOS devices too.

### **Personal Profile Page**

Organize your bio and post all your codes and links. Promote all your referral codes with a single link. Let others use your codes. Your profile page will be available on the mobile app, with a user-friendly interface specifically fit for smartphones. You just have to reach for your pocket to show your friends your neat profile!

### **The Community**

Think of your favorite dating app, but with no swiping left or right. Always engage with the community whenever possible. With the mobile app, Invitation aims to let you exchange referral codes with your friends and followers. You'll still be able to discuss referral programs and ways to earn online.

### **Invitation Coins**

Are you someone who likes a gamified experience? The Invitation coins are a phenomenon among active users. Do simple tasks on your Invitation mobile app, and you'll get coins from time to time. With the launch of the mobile app, you can expect more tasks to do on your Invitation profile.

### **Referral Programs List**

It's important to be updated on the next possible passive income stream. Your favorite apps and services always launch new referral programs. With the mobile app, you can easily see what apps and sites to try out, where you can invite your friends to earn more rewards. Another great way to earn extra using your smartphone, without being a hassle to your phone memory.

### **Pro Plans**

If you find yourself enjoying the mobile app that we will launch, you can directly upgrade your profile to premium, to gain more rewards and reach. Invitation is also planning to make it possible for you to purchase a plan using your phone, so you can securely grab more perks on your Invitation profile.

### **Open to Suggestions**

We would definitely love to hear from you. We're a small team that will independently work on making this possible for the growing community. These main features will surely be on the mobile app, if you think we missed out on something, let us know by messaging @support.
