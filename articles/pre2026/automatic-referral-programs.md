It has become convenient for everyone how automatic most things are nowadays. Almost every process or service that you can think of has been simplified. A great example would be automatic payments. In the past you would have to go to a bank or payment center to settle something, but now your payment can be taken from your bank account within a few minutes.

### **Automated services**

There are multiple apps that have made it possible to make various services automated. This kind of convenience is like an automatic car, there are fewer steps in driving one. However, there are some who still prefer to stay with the usual processes.

### **Joining the trend**

To reel in these kinds of consumers, most companies have implemented referral programs, where people you invite can enjoy something automatic with you. On top of that, you'll get bonuses for it such as lower subscription or product prices. Here's a good list of those kinds of apps and services with referral programs.
