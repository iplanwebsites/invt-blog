The popularity of fantasy sports as a fun online game is continuously rising. You can set up a virtual team of your favorite players where their statistics reflect their performance in their real-life teams. It can be compared to being a trader in the stock market where you can buy, sell and trade players to accumulate more points.

### **Playing strategically**

You could actually win prizes or cash if you end up being the top of a specific leaderboard at the end of the season. This depends on what type of fantasy sports you are playing. Some last a week or a month while the usual ones last a whole sports season. To have lower risks, you need to be knowledgeable about current events in the sports industry as they reflect the stats of plays within the game.

### **Win extra**

These kinds of platforms have referral programs to have a more competitive environment. The more users are there, the higher the prize pool. If you invite a friend over, you can get referral rewards ranging from lower transaction fees to discounts when you trade on their platforms. If you're an avid player of these games, here's a good list of them that you can try out. Use a referral code from one of these programs to get a bonus!
