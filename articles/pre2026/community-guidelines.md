Invitation is an ad-free, independent, community. It lets people organize and share their referral codes for various products. Rewards and savings have brought us together.

Invitation is a positive and friendly community. If you find this platform as your home, great news, we feel the same way. It’s the people that shape what trends and discussions are active. While everyone agrees that the more people, the merrier, we want to maintain this positive environment that all of you experience (that’s why we always welcome feedback).

We want to keep the platform fair and fun for everyone.&nbsp; We hope these guidelines will let us focus more on excitement, sharing and positivity we cultivate!&nbsp;

Don’t worry, our guidelines are easy to follow as they are just dos and don'ts. We are establishing them so that we can all avoid abuse and bad things within the community.

## **Do**

**Be nice**. There's really no point in ruining someone else’s day. We're all here to make friends and earn rewards, which are pretty positive things - let's keep it that way.

**Share** **your knowledge**. Share your referral offers, or even your ideas. Add value in your exchanges and messages by making them personalized instead of templates. It doesn’t hurt to be friendly!

**Use the appropriate channels**. There are plenty of channels for the right uses. If your message is of public interest, post on your profile or make a discussion with it instead of sending a private message. Advertising also has the right channel or group. So, if you want to promote something, do it appropriately. We highly discourage posting your referral codes or links to discussion channels, it defeats the purpose of having your personalized profile page on Invitation.

**Respect others. **Everyone is welcome at Invitation. We value inclusivity and solidarity. No one deserves to be treated badly. After all, we are all human.&nbsp;

## **Don’t:**

**Don't spam.** Posting repetitive messages, codes or links doesn’t work. There is a respective page for you to post your referral codes and links. Spam only pushes people away. If you want higher chances, just do it once.

**Don't promote illegal activities**. No one wants something that is shady. These kinds of things would only bring you and others harm than good. There are ways to earn without compromising everyone’s safety.

**Don't cheat**. It's not nice, it's not fair. This includes misleading and outdated offers, baiting users and other forms of hacking. You might succeed once, but they don’t really work twice.

**Don't break the site**. We’re a small, passionate team working to give you a better experience. We always aim to stay on top of everyone’s concerns. Unwanted issues would only slow down the site’s progress.&nbsp;

## **Avatars/Usernames**&nbsp;

Your avatar and username are a great way of personalizing your profile, and making yourself stand out from the crowd. However, since everyone can see them, your avatar and username must adhere to some guidelines too:

No nudity and clothing must be appropriate for all ages

No swearing, offensive messages or gestures

No pictures which could cause offense/upset (i.e. depictions of violence, injury, racism, sexism or other scenes likely to cause distress and negativity)

Must not contain misleading brand logo, name or variants of either, which could mislead users (i.e. @elonmusk username, @coinbase logo profile picture)

Bonus point: Post a picture of you, it's nice to see fellow humans!

## **Enforcement**

We have a variety of ways of enforcing our rules, including, but not limited to

Asking you nicely to knock it off

Asking you less nicely

Temporary or permanent suspension of accounts

Removal of privileges from, or adding restrictions to, accounts

Adding restrictions to products, domains, such as adding “scam” tags or hiding.

Removal of content

Banning on Invitation’s products and features
