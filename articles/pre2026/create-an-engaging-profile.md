Making your page title and intro

Sharing your personal codes/links

Putting your most preferred social link

Being active in the community

These 5 tips will surely make your profile look great. We'll discuss each tip on how you can use them to your advantage.

## **Selecting the Right Profile Picture**

If someone goes to your profile page, one of the first things that they will look at is your picture. The simplest profile picture that you can use is a picture of yourself, only if you are comfortable with others seeing who you are. A simple selfie works, but remember, a picture is worth a thousand words. Try tweaking your picture a bit, so that it gives hints of what you do or what you promote. For example, if you're a musician, you can take a picture with your favorite instrument. The key to selecting the right profile picture is showing something that others can relate to.

## **Making Your Page Title and Intro**

There are two key questions to answer when creating your page title. First, how do you want to break the ice? You could use something like what would be your common interest with others. Second, what impression do you want to leave on people? We as people have complex personalities and an impression is just a part of it. However, impression is what makes people remember you. So, always try to consider what your branding is, or how you want to present yourself when making your page title.

An intro is just a short story that you can tell people. There's no right or wrong here, so the best way to make a good intro is to be yourself. You could put things like, why you love Invitation, or what made you stay on the platform, your daily lifestyle, or anything that you're willing to share to others.

## **Sharing Your Personal Codes/Links**

Just to recall, this is about setting up your profile and making it engaging, so one of the best ways to make it presentable is by sharing codes or links that you already use. If the products or services are available on Invitation (most likely they are), then post all the codes you have as much as possible. This guarantees others that the referral program is active, and it gives your profile a great look and [potential visibility](https://next.invitation.codes/mag/gain-more-visibility).

It's okay to post codes that you recently discovered, especially if you found them on Invitation. The edge of the ones that you regularly use, however, is that you're more familiar with them. That means when people ask you about it, you can easily answer them right away!

## **Putting Your Most Preferred Social Link**

The first three tips of this guide gets people's attention. This next tip focuses on building relationships or connections. Most people who are drawn to your profile are more likely to chat or follow you on your other social media accounts.

You could also put Invitation widgets on your website or social media accounts, and Invitation even rewards you for it. It's one of the sure ways of building your network!

## **Being Active in the Community**

Basically, just make friends on Invitation, the community is growing every day, so there are always new people to meet.
