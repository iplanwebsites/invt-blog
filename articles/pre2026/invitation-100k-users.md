Hey everyone! We're delighted to announce that Invitation has reached 100,000 active users. It has not been that long since the platform was created. Yet, we are continuously overwhelmed by the growing community. We've come a long way, and we wouldn't make it to this point without your support.

What makes Invitation unique is the people. The discussions and sharing of news regarding the newest referrals bring users closer. Everyone then discovers their common interests. The community is full of newfound friends, different kinds of people that brought together by the daily apps and services they use. It's exciting to see that the community website started as a way to bring all your referral codes and links into one page, so that you can share them to other people. As the team believed in this goal, more and more of you joined and trusted us.

Invitation is a platform that can help you earn small passive income. As we always say, you'll quickly realize that even small rewards can be surprisingly lucrative over the long term. The platform was made so that even with little work, you can reap those sweet bonuses over time. Isn't it fun and casual?

As a way of saying thanks, we'll be giving all the 100,000 users a special profile badge! This would show new users registering on Invitation that you're one of the early adopters. That would look sweet on your profile too. We always want to aim to give you the best for being a loyal user. Another added bonus that everyone will get is 5 free reposts. You're special to us, and we always want you to feel this way.

Thanks for stopping by and reading this huge milestone for the team. We hope to see you on the next big thing for the team. Cheers! ðŸ¥³
