It's a tough world out there. You're reading this, so you probably know that being an influencer is no cakewalk.

You put in tons of hard work and hours to make it all happen, but your audience grows only slowly. People ask you how much money you make, but when they find out the truth, they are aghast. A huge part of your life is devoted to making content and taking pictures for your social media accounts.

Sometimes you wish you could go back to a regular job with a regular paycheck, but you know that if only more people saw your hard work, they would surely follow you.

You may not make a lot of money, but there is no doubt that being an influencer has been the most rewarding job I've ever had.

I write about this topic because in my experience, people are quick to judge without understanding what it takes to be successful at it.

Being an influencer isn't all rainbows and unicorns. There are downsides, but if you can avoid these pitfalls, you will have a much better chance of succeeding.

## **The cons to being an influencer:**

### **1. You must hustle hard to gain your audience's trust and attention.**

You can't just expect people to show up and love you without earning it. To build an audience, you need to create high-quality content that is useful or entertaining to them. If they don't see the value in what you are doing, then they won't follow you. You need to develop a strategy and stick with it. One approach won't work for everyone, so you will have to experiment until you find what works best for your audience. Content creation is an investment in the beginning, but as your followers grow, so does your ability to make money through advertising or affiliate sales.

### **2. You must give up a large part of your life to succeed.**

It's easy to fall into the trap of spending all day on social media, hoping that you will gain new followers and sell more products. You need to plan out how much time you can devote each week to social media and stick to it. If you spread yourself too thin, then you won't be able to do quality work for your audience. That will frustrate them and make them unsubscribe from your accounts.

### **3. You must understand that making money as an influencer is a slow process.**

You won't get rich overnight. Even the most famous influencers have worked for years to get where they are today. While it's true that there are those who have achieved stardom overnight, you will never hear about their failures or the years of hustle that they put in before they got to that point.

### **4. You must understand the power of platforms and networks.**

To build your audience, you need to spread your content on multiple social media accounts. I believe that having at least 3 different accounts (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) is best for building a large following.

### **5. You must understand the power of influencer marketing.**

As an influencer, you have a built-in audience that is ready to see what you promote. This means that if you work with brands and endorse their products, your followers will be eager to buy them as well. For example, I often work with companies on sponsored posts or giveaways. After my followers see that I'm promoting a product, they are much more likely to buy it because they trust me and believe in what I have to say.

If you're interested in becoming an influencer, then be prepared for the long haul. You must invest time and money into building your brand, but if you are willing to put in the work, then I believe that you can become a successful influencer with great results.
