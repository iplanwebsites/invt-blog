Buying something online is really a convenient way to spend your money. It's cheaper compared to going to a physical store. Most stores offer lower prices, as they have cheaper costs on setting up in various e-commerce platforms.

### **Cheaper retail products**

You can get a good deal by browsing online. Prices tend to be lower when various products are purchased online. Some say that they're the same because there are shipping fees to pay. What if we told you that there are lower fees that you could avail on top of possible discounts? Retail apps and sites have referral programs set up on their platforms too.

### **Invite a friend, spend less**

If you have friends that like shopping, you're both in for a great deal. With referral programs, both you and your friend can get more discounts. Try out these apps and sites we listed on Invitation. On top of being trustworthy brands, you're in for a treat when you invite more friends to shop with you on these platforms. Have fun purchasing the things you love!
