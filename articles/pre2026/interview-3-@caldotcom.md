The Invitation community is rich in diversity because referral or affiliate marketing is something that every type of person can jump into. From crypto traders, influencers, or even the average netizen, there is nothing that can stop you from starting this. This article introduces another awesome Invitation user and talks about a journey of making referral or affiliate marketing into a fun passive income stream. Have fun reading as @caldotcom shares a long and wonderful experience that we can relate to!

## **How did you get into this?**

I started with affiliate marketing many years ago when trying to get credits for a freemium game when I was a kid. Safe to say I was able to buy the item I wanted shortly after haha!

## **What do you like most about affiliate/referral marketing?**

It's easy passive income. There's a LOT that you can do to increase your payouts, but I see myself as pretty reserved and don't aggressively seek out referrals.

It can be a 'set and forget' type of market but if you want to put the time and effort into it then the payoffs can be worth it.

## **What's your angle to it?**

I tend to be sociable in my posts/responses. I come from a Customer Service background, so if I can relate to some random thought on the internet, get them some benefits (and hopefully a smile) then that's a bonus for me. I'll sign up for some larger referral names but tend to focus on pushing niche names to more users for exposure.

## **Does it feed to your other occupation (YouTuber, freelancer, etc)?**

It doesn't feed into my other occupation, privately employed in IT, but does help me with bonuses here and there that I can funnel into other interests :)

## **What would you say to someone who is just starting out to help them?**

It's overwhelming, and that's perfectly fine. Affiliate Marketing has been around for decades (the Tupperware in your cupboard says hello) but at this point of technological access, it has changed and is much more approachable for newcomers. You may get smacked down by some larger players, some people will be incredibly rude. However, if you stick to it and don't get stuck on the negative part of the community, then you may surprise yourself where you'll be in due course.

## **How do you use Invitation, and what benefits did it brought you?**

I actually love the social aspect of Invitation. The profile and being able to make friends is great, you can check out some friends or other users you've connected with and prioritize their codes. Boosting the performance of your codes is incredibly easy to do and is a quick injection of referrals when on the run.

## **What is your favorite feature?**

Probably seeing my statistics, not just for my individual codes but my profile itself.

(Shoutout to @Support by the way, they are incredibly responsive, attentive, and even go out of their way to take on feedback and address issues.)

## **Any words of caution to newcomers?**

Don't sink fiat/cryptocurrency into anything. Build up your knowledge of platforms and if one is working really well for you, then look into financially supporting it and your goals. It's always good to err on the side of caution, but not to detriment.

The statement "Never put your eggs in one basket" proves true even today. Having fun earning doesn't mean you always have to take a risk, and that's what our guest, @caldotcom, taught us today. It's always more fun to be involved in something once you know a lot about it. If we know a lot, then we're less likely to be stressed. Definitely a win-win situation.
