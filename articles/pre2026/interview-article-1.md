How's it going guys? One of the goals here on Invitation is to bring people together. The best way to approach this is through testimonials! Here's a first part of a series of interviews with all kinds of members here on the platform. Join us as we get to know the people who are active in the community, and let's all learn their life-hacks and learnings on Invitation. The first member to be featured in this series is @CryptoKing.

## **How did you get into referral programs?**

I started reading about cryptocurrency back in 2012 when Coinbase first listed Bitcoin and immediately sensed that cryptocurrency was going to be huge. Over the years, new exchanges started popping up everywhere, and I could see how important the referral programs for these exchanges were, because it was a new technology that was unheard of, and people were nervous to invest into it. I have been a part of numerous forums and groups who discuss the newest coins or tokens. I have tried to use my knowledge to help people understand the technology and answer any questions for them. In turn, I would just ask that they use my referral code to sign up. People were receptive to use it because often, it benefits both of us.

## **What’s your angle to it?**

I found that building trust by being helpful and knowledgeable made people understand that I was never trying to push my referral codes on them. I always tell people that I am not an “expert” or a financial advisor, so I will not tell you where to put your money in but can tell you what coins I like and why.

## **What do you like most about referral marketing?**

What I enjoy most about referral marketing is that I can promote and teach people about something I love, while passively earning extra money or coins for my efforts.&nbsp;

## **How did you find Invitation, and what do you like about it?**

I found Invitation when I first did a Google search for a place to post different types of referral links, and was immediately hooked in with the design of the website, the ability to submit suggestions for new websites, and the Chrome extension. I do not have as much time on the forums since I started a company with my sisters, so Invitation has been a great way for me to gain exposure and answer questions for people in one location.

## **What is your favorite Invitation feature?**&nbsp;

My favorite part of the website is the ability to track which of my links are doing well with views and clicks, and decide which take precedence when reposting. When posting on forums and groups, it was impossible to track this, so I could not figure out what interested people.&nbsp;

## **What would you say to someone who is just starting out on Invitation to help them?**

I would tell newcomers to try and earn your coins, and upgrade to the supersonic package or spend them wisely. I love being able to repost 20 times a month. Furthermore, I would also say if you want to post the same site as someone else, be sure to use their referral link as a courtesy thank you.

## **Anything that you would like to say to readers?**
