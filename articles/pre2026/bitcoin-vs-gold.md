The comparison of bitcoin and gold is a topic of growing interest among people such as investors, traders, and analysts. It’s a debate between a historical asset that has proven its store of value and a rising currency that is digital in nature. In this article, you’ll find their similarities and differences.

## **The Similarities**

Both are bitcoin and gold are "mined" for, they are found, not built or manufactured. Both have intrinsic value in a way that can be used as a fungible medium of exchange between other people. Furthermore, both currently enjoy acceptance as fiat with certified value and purchasing power due to their worth.

## **The Differences**

Bitcoin is a way to send money between people and gold is a currency in and of itself. Both have current market costs that are vastly different (and ascend towards infinity). One is a bearer certificate and one isn't. One is accepted for taxation and the other isn't.

Now, one would argue that gold has value for the same reasons as Bitcoin does. They are both valued as currency by themselves, without a government certification of value or acceptance. The rebuttal to this would be, that it is easier to steal gold than to steal Bitcoin. That is true, but it is also less complicated to administer a gold hoard than it is to manage a mined Bitcoin account.

Regardless of the arguments one can make for and against each other's worth, it is clear that they are both held as valuable by some people. Gold does have certain properties that make it a better currency than Bitcoin does. That being said, Bitcoin has some properties that make it more useful as a medium of exchange than gold is too. It all depends on your viewpoint and needs.
