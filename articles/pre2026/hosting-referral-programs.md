It's annoying to switch website hosts, so companies are investing aggressively into referrals. If you are a developer, work in tech or related field, you might earn generous rewards by recommending hosting and domain names providers. DigitalOcean is especially easy to recommend as it's priced very aggressively.

### **Lower your hosting costs**

On top of the invite bonus, companies making to switch can slash their hosting cost in half. We recommend services with rewards or not, so it just makes sense to claim our due. Who doesn't love free computing?
