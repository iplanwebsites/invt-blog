Are you an active user who likes to interact with others? You might have seen posts of people introducing themselves or looking to exchange referral codes/links in the [Discussions](https://next.invitation.codes/discuss) page. Interactions are everywhere. It's undeniable that belongingness is a necessity for everyone. However, a genuine interaction always goes both ways. Can you really call it engagement, if only one person is sharing?

We're writing this article with the thought of helping you create engaging posts in Invitation's Discussion page. Yeah, people like to share codes, but is that page all that it is? Invitation aims to bringing people closer together. Here's what we'll talk about:

Choosing a topic

Being presentable with your thoughts

Driving response and CTAs

Establishing a connection

It might seem a long topic, but believe us, this article's a quick read.

### Choosing a topic üí°

What do you want to talk about? Always think that you're a person and not some business. But even if you're a business, having a personality is a key to interaction. Don't think of keywords, think about being straight to the point. Choose a topic that you want to share (put them on the right category too), and you're going to have people replying to your posts right away! For example, what's the latest deal in your area? Or on an interesting note, are there any limited-time referral deals that you know of?

### Being presentable with your thoughts üìã

A post is a good-read if it's visually presented. You have something to say? Make a list. Create highlights of what you want to tell people. If you've reached this part of the article, then you were subtly hooked in the ideas shared here. That's the magic of interaction, it keeps you interested.

### Driving response and CTAs üì£

Now you've said what you wanted to say, it shouldn't end there. Since an interaction goes both ways, it's your goal to get a reply or a comment from what you posted. Ask people what they think, lead them in a way that they will be comfortable in opening up and sharing their side rather than forcing them to do something. An interaction shouldn't oblige, it should motivate reaction.

### Establishing a connection ü§ù

Don't let a conversation end without a connection. Tell others to follow you and follow them too, to keep in touch. That way, you made a new friend online, and you'll have someone to message when you're on Invitation. People exchange referral codes too, it's a great step to building a network with fellow referral users.

Your posts on the Discussions page should not be just a link (post it to your peofile). The Discussions page offers an opportunity to share tips, good ways to earn online that you've stumbled upon, and connection with people near you. In every deal hunter, there's a great writer that offers insights and helps others.

Like we said, this is a quick-read, and yours should be too. A quality post leads to quality engagement, which can convert into new referrals that will get you your bonuses. Excited to know more?
