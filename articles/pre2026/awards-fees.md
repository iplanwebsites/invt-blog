We’re grateful that most users gave positive feedback for the “Awards” feature. This milestone success has motivated the team to improve the feature further. Our inbox received messages too about the fees and processes for “Awards”.

Today, we wrote this article to help everyone understand how fees work for the [Awards/Donations feature](https://next.invitation.codes/mag/awards-and-donations). We also have suggestions on how you can make the most out of it!

### Stripe Fees

Payment channels have different processing fees that help users complete a transaction smoothly. Stripe is no exception. On the website, everyone who makes a transaction through the Awards feature are subject to Stripe fees: $0.30 + 2.9% of the amount.

### Invitation Fees

We try to keep it as low as possible, but we still need a small revenue to manage servers and ensure that there’s no fraudulent activities.
Users on the free and Turbo plans will also pay a 5% platform fee. This is really a small amount compared to other social media websites, but will be a huge help to Invitation’s small team working on the whole platform.&nbsp;

If you’re on the higher-tiered plans like Supersonic and Super100, this platform fee is waived.

### How much will I get?

Unlike some other platforms, the person sending you money doesn't pay any extra fee. They pay $5 to give you $5. We feel it’s the best experience for donors, but it also means you have to pay the transaction fees.

Let’s say one of your followers gives you $10. Stripe fee would cost $0.59 ($0.30 + 2.9%*$10). Invitation fee will be $0.50 (5%*$10). If you’re on the free or Turbo plan, your total fee would $1.09, it’s technically the best option available compared to the convenience that you’ll get from everyone giving you donations!

For users on the higher tiered plans, your fees would only be $0.59 since the 5% platform fee will be waived. If you think about it, your plan is really valuable because you get prime visibility, and lower costs.

Because of the Awards feature, more users have more ways to earn through Invitation. Aside from this fact, the pro plans are just gonna get better. Imagine being able to earn more because if you think about it, it’s free to create an Invitation account.

It’s definitely the best time to upgrade. Imagine having so many followers, and many Invitation users are generous because of the positive community. You’re bound to earn a lot more on the pro plans! You can also message us for any questions about the fees, we’d be happy to assist you in choosing the best plan for your account too (you might get a discount coupon!).&nbsp;&nbsp;
