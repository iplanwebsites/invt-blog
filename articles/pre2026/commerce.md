In 2022, we'll continue to grow the community, analyze referral programs and use too much emoji.[âœŠ](https://emojis.wiki/raised-fist/)ðŸ’¥

But we also wish to lower merchants acquisition costs through successful referral programs.

We're launching a new toolkit for merchants. [ðŸŽ‰](https://emojipedia.org/party-popper/)
It will let them effortlessly create and run a successful loyalty program.

The big deal? Those merchants will be able to tap our community of 200,000 mini-influencers, giving unprecedented visibility to their store, and boosting conversion of Invitation's members on their store.

We've written about 3,500+ referral programs. We know what works and what doesn't, but we also know that most referral softwares sucks for e-commerce.

They usually are are:

Overly expensive

A pain to setup / manage

Clunky

A pain to use for your customers

Poorly integrated

Unless you have a product that naturally has a network effect, this added friction probably means you're getting a low rate of referrals from your customers. And with the high cost associated with those referral software platform, you're probably eating too much of your margins on what should be your **most profitable channel**.

Referral is the future. Advertising costs continuing to go up, will just make referrals more valuable.
We want online merchants to be able to launch a referral program in 5 minutes, at minimal cost.

Curious to hear more? Just fill out this form and we'll be in touch shortly!
