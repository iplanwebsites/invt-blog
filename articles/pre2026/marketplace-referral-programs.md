Marketplace apps and sites are fun communities. You get to buy and sell products you use to people who possibly have the same interests with you. It's like a more personalized business model. What makes these apps and sites more enjoyable is that those who organize or create them offer referral rewards too.

### **Towards a bigger market**

As you invite more to their platform, the authentic community grows (like us at Invitation!). You don't have to find them elsewhere, as we have collected them in a big list that you'll find just below this article. Try joining these marketplace apps and sites today!
