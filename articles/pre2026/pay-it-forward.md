It has been a rollercoaster ride for Invitation ever since the website started last year in 2020. A simple idea of making the most out of referral rewards turned out to be something big, not just for the users who stayed from the beginning, but also to the team that has been working on the platform.

## **Our journey so far**

We’ve grown a lot since last year. It wouldn’t be possible without you guys. We’ve been overwhelmed by your support, and that’s what kept us going every day. With that said, Invitation has BIG plans for the future especially for the active community, and the future of referral marketing.

Thousands of users earn rewards on the site by diligently posting their referral codes and links daily. The team always strives to give you a valuable experience. You earn from referral codes and links, with a few bonuses from us that makes your rewards more worthwhile. We’re surprised that everyone liked Invitation coins too, especially its gamified system that makes your time more fun.

## **How you can support us in the future**

If you’re one of the users who have earned something with Invitation, or just enjoy the idea of supporting a small, yet growing community website, it’d be really awesome if you could [buy us a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/invitation), sign up for a pro plan, or just send a few doge coins our way! It might be a small amount, but it really does help us go a long way. If you’d like to upgrade to pro plan, use the exclusive code supporter2021 to get an extra 15% off on the yearly plans!

We haven’t sold our soul to tech-giants and advertisers, and we’d love to keep it that way and stay authentic. The team is still far from profitable and running purely on passion and drive. As of now, we’re halfway into building an entirely new app too (the current website has major flaws, we know).

This is our way of paying it forward as you support us. As much as possible, we really want to double our manpower on development, and we would need the funds. Going back to what we said earlier, the support that you give us serve as our big steps into creating a valuable experience for you and your referrals.

## **Other ways you can support the team**

There are ways that you can support us other than financial means. If you’re someone who’s rich on time and love to gain experience, this would be a great opportunity for us to work together. Here are some ways that you can help:

**Writing**: As we launch a new site and app, we also plan to publish more regularly, and we’re actively looking for writers to make quality content for Invitation.

**Coding**: We use JS everywhere: Chrome extension, mobile apps, Flutter, Vue, Node. It's not simple to onboard junior resources, but we might find a small project you could work on.

**Moderating** **content**: We always need help in reviewing programs and filtering out spam. It's a never-ending chase, but thankfully, we got better at it as we made it a priority. Invitation always updates referral programs’ information daily.

**Draw**: We'd love to work with creatives to give life to new designs for the growing community to see!

**Proofreading**: We publish content with help of our most active members. Let's just say we speak better in JavaScript than English, so having some help proofreading our articles would be a huge help to the community.

We want to thank you for the strong support you’ve given us. Over the course of last year, we enjoyed learning so many things along the way, and as time goes by, we’re definitely excited of what’s to come. Join us in this journey towards the future of referral marketing!
