Referral marketing has come a long way because of innovations in the digital space. The concept of referrals opened opportunities for anyone looking to earn extra income. Referrals are not a one-man job, you need other people too. The best way to start is to find your community.

There’s always a benefit of joining a group of people, especially when you have the same goals as others. Referral marketing is honest networking. Today, we’ll talk about what benefits you could have by being in a community of referral marketers and deal hunters.

### An established network with opportunities

Think about crypto traders. To get the latest news, they discuss new digital assets and platforms. When’s the best time to buy and to sell? Other than information channels, you get these kinds of tips when you connect with others.

For referral programs, there may be limited-time deals. Another instance would be updates on sign-up bonuses. An established network could come in handy when you’re looking for new sign-up offers, or opportunities to share your referral deals.

### First-hand information on existing deals

Self research has limits. Sometimes, no matter how hard you try to find details on referral programs that you’re interested in, they’re not available. This is where a referral community comes in. Other users like you have experiences with various referral deals. You can consider insider information that only they know.

Invitation is a stacked platform of information for thousands of referral programs. But what makes the website special, is the contribution from all users. We see submissions daily that are sometimes not really available on browser search. That’s why having a referral community is also valuable not just for websites like us, but for the users who are directly participating in referral programs.

### Source of positivity and a sense of belonging

According to Helen Keller, “Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much”. With all that’s happening around the world, most of us need a source of strong human connection to get through. A community is built around shared interests and support. Joining one gives you a sense of belonging.

This is how we say that you’re not in this alone. You’ll find opportunities to earn extra and get more referrals when you build a connection with a group of people. Aside from these rewards, you’ll meet new friends. The experience is guaranteed to be easier and worthwhile.

### Is there a referral community that I can be a part of?

Social media websites are great areas for finding a community of referral marketers and deal hunters. However, Invitation makes things simpler. One of the features that you can take advantage of is our discussions page. Users can comment on your posts, follow you and look at your profile page.

Imagine other websites like refer.codes and tastyreferrals.com, both of which are platforms where people can find information on referral programs. Unfortunately, it ends there. You only see codes and posts, but don’t have the option to engage with who owns them or to ask more details.

Invitation believes that a tight community builds a better referral platform. At the end of the day, you have to share your referral codes or links somewhere. But with a referral community, you have better chances of getting more referrals. If you’d like to start one, you can go ahead and post on the “[discuss](https://next.invitation.codes/discuss)” section. What do you think of joining a referral community?
