Did you know that Canadians pay some of the [most expensive cell phone bills](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadas-wireless-costs-continue-to-be-the-highest-or-among-the-highest-in-the-world-finnish-report) in the world? On top of this, the recent effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have forced us to work from home, and sign up for more demanding internet plans. As a result, opportunities to save on telecom services have never been more important to Canadians.&nbsp;

Thankfully, many providers offer rewards for referring friends or family to their services. We’ll keep you up to date on all the best internet and mobile plan referral programs in Canada.

## Best Mobile Plan Referral Programs Canada

First up, Canada’s “big three” telecom providers offer some interesting referral bonuses. Both Rogers and Telus provide a $50 bill credit for both the “referrer” and “referee” when you introduce a friend or family member to a new phone plan.&nbsp;

Similarly, Virgin Plus and Lucky Mobile offer the exact same referral bonus, allowing both parties to save $50 on their phone bill. Fizz Mobile and Koodo provide similar referral bonuses, with both members saving $25 on their bill. However, Fizz has a special promotion currently going on, which allows users to save $40 if they sign up before the end of March 2022.&nbsp;

Finally, Fido’s referral program ensures that you and your friend receive a bill credit equivalent to one month of your mobile plan. So, depending on your specific plan, Fido’s referral program could end up saving you the most money.

## More ways to save on your mobile plan

There are other ways to save money on your mobile plans. Instead of resorting to referral programs, you can order SIM cards from more economic carriers. Providers like Fonus or DotMobile provide unlimited texting/calling and data at 5G speeds. All you need to do is order a SIM card for $15 and pay $30 a month. These services are VoIP based so some native phone features work a bit differently (which is often inconvenient).

If you’re struggling to find affordable plans from major providers, you should consider seeking out simpler, more affordable providers. Carriers like Chatr, Cityfone, and Public Mobile let users build their own plans from the ground up. They don’t offer referral programs (as I’m writing this article), but their prices are quite aggressive (for Canadian standards).

### Comparing plans using Planhub

Last but not the least, Canadians can use PlanHub’s website to quickly compare mobile plans and secure the best deal. Disclosure: I co-founded PlanHub in 2014.

We created a [mobile plan searching tool](https://www.planhub.ca/) that takes a few seconds to complete, and find the best deal for you. After answering a few basic questions about your preferences, our website will present you with a list of the best, most affordable phone plans that match your needs.&nbsp;

From there, all you need to do is choose a single plan from the list that you feel strongly about. Combining PlanHub’s services, referral programs and plans from economic providers, you can significantly reduce your monthly phone bill.

## Summary of the best mobile referral program for Canadians

To keep track of all the best mobile rewards you and your family can access, check out the list below (they're also on Invitation's list of referral programs):

### [Telus Mobile Reward Program](https://invitation.codes/telus-mobility) - $50 Bill Credit

Send your friend(s) a referral link when you sign up with Telus

Earn $50 off your next bill for every cell phone they activate with your link

Your friends will also gain a credit of $50 when they activate their plan

### [Fizz Mobile Reward Program](https://invitation.codes/fizz) - $40 Bill Credit (Usually $25)

Send your friend(s) a referral code when you sign up with Fizz

Earn $40 off your next bill&nbsp;

Your friends will also gain a credit of $40 when they activate their plan

### [Fido Mobile Reward Program](https://invitation.codes/fido) - One Month Free

Send one friend a referral code when you sign up with Fido

If you are eligible, you will both receive a credit equivalent to the price of one month of your mobile plan

## Best Internet Referral Programs in Canada

Sadly, internet referral programs are less common in Canada than programs for mobile plans. Out of Canada’s big three telecom providers, only Telus offers a referral bonus for internet plans. Their program is identical to their mobile plan reward, and awards $50 credit to both users involved.&nbsp;

Similarly, Fizz rewards a $25 referral bonus to both you and the friend you refer to their service. Once again, their March 2022 promotion is also in effect for their internet referral program.&nbsp;

Lastly, Oxio offers a $25 referral bonus for both parties. However, they are currently offering a limited time promotion which grants both users a free month of Oxio internet. As long as this unbeatable promotion remains active, it will be one of the best referral programs in the country.&nbsp;

Just like for mobile plans, internet users all over Canada can rely on PlanHub to help save money on their next internet plan. Our[ internet plan searching tool](https://www.planhub.ca/home-internet) works similarly to our mobile plan tool. After responding to a few simple questions, you’ll be matched with a number of affordable internet plans that match your needs. After choosing one from our list and combining it with a referral program, you’ll be able to save considerably on your internet.

Once again, if you’re interested in one of these rewards plans for your next internet plan, feel free to read through the list below:

## Conclusion

Canadians shouldn’t have to end up spending absurd amounts of money on mobile and internet bills. Thankfully, things like referral programs are a great way to reduce such unfair prices. When searching for a plan with a referral program, make sure to read the fine print or even get in touch with the provider.&nbsp;

While some referral rewards can only be accessed once, others can be redeemed multiple times. This way, you and your friends can end up saving hundreds on your yearly telecom bills. Whenever you’re shopping or researching plans, make sure to keep an eye out. There are many ways to help you save, you just need to know where to look!
