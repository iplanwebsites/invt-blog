You asked for it, we made it!

You can now show your appreciation to other members by buying them awards. These awards then would show on their profile. Everyone will know these members are valuable and trustworthy. People who received awards also receive perks like extra reposts and Invitation coins. There’s also a new leaderboard highlighting the glorious members who received the most awards. Our hall of fame.

### How does it work?

Invitation’s awards are straightforward and simple. You can directly send them to a user who you would like to donate to. There will be an upcoming leaderboard for users with the most awards too.

### Prefer cash to donations?&nbsp;

Now, you can receive donations directly on your Invitation profile.

Other platforms like Patreon, IndieGogo, Kickstarter, or OnlyFrens let all type of influencers fund their content creation through donations, but they often take a large cut and require that you create yet another profile.

With Invitation, your friends will be able to “buy you a pizza” for $5 without creating an account. We wanted to give you the easiest way to collect donations.

Your supporters can pay by credit card in any currencies, and proceeds are deposited directly into your bank account. Our platform fees are only 5% for users on the free plan (plus Stripe fees of ~3%).

### Make it personal

Ask your visitors to choose between buying you a coffee, a beer or a pizza. A personalized message will let your audience better connect with you and know you a bit better. How do you plan to use the feature? Do you prefer awards or cold hard cash? Any creative ideas to reach your potential supporters?
