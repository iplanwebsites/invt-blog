Social media has become an essential part of our daily lives. It’s the way we connect with our family and friends. It has also become the means that we show ourselves to others. Therefore, it has become a vital part for every social media platform to show how’s your progress when it comes to your posts, content or anything that you share. With that said, we’ll talk about another feature available on Invitation, “Stats”.

## **How does it work?**

Invitation’s Stats are one of the most comprehensive and detailed feature there is. First, it shows your traffic. Your stats page also show your post and profile views. For what purpose? To inform you what works and what doesn’t. There’s no solution that fits all, so the algorithm that you see on your profile helps you know where you’re at.

Your stats also show where your reach or traffic comes from. In that way, you’ll know what to do with your Invitation profile next. For example, should you post more? Or should engage within the discussion pages more? It’s great for everyone, especially for people who like to plan ahead.

Other than your profile and posts stats, you’ll also see on your page some of our suggestions on what you can do next. You can also do it in your free time. If you ever need direction, or just want to see how far you’ve gone within Invitation, simply go to your Stats page.

## **What’s next?**

Your stats are easily accessible on your profile as you can click “Track performance”. Once there, you can now see [a detailed view of all your stats](https://invitation.codes/profile/grow). This page also has a nice interface, and shows you what you need to know.

If you’re a person who likes to monitor your progress, then this feature is perfect for you. Because for Invitation, it’s always nice to know something that can help you grow. Cheers!
