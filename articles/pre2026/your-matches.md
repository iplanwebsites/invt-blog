## **Dating for referrals&nbsp;**

Dating can sometimes be stressful. Most of the time, you always have to put your best foot forward. Sometimes, we all wish that we could skip to the good part, and just enjoy the company of the person we fancy or have common interests with.&nbsp;

Invitation has created a feature that makes your referral journey easier, and skips to the good part of the process. Today, we’ll talk about “Matches”.

## **How does it work?**

Referrals are a multiplayer game. Invitation’s matches lets you discover other users on the website that have similar interests with you. You might be wondering, how does Invitation know your matches? It’s by looking at users who post codes or links from similar programs.

It's a bit like a dating platform, without the awkward pickup lines and ghosting. You also won't receive pics from your matches, which is all for the better. The matches list always refresh daily. So, you get to meet new people every day when you log in on the website.

## **What’s next?**

After logging in, check [your top 20 matches for the day](https://invitation.codes/people/matches). On your top 20 matches, you have the option to follow them or message them. You can also do both if you want to talk to users who have the same interests as you.

Matches are a great way to build your referral empire through reaching out to the community. It’s less hassle, since you already have something to build rapport with other people, which is the referral programs that you both signed up for. What’s not to love about meeting others and sharing rewards?
