## **Participating in Discussions**

If you like engaging in forums, then this step is easy for you. There are many discussions you can participate in within the Invitation community. Depending on your niche, you can promote your codes to other members on the platform. For example, you're a crypto trader looking for the latest news, there are others like you who are actively discussing what deals to take advantage of. The diversity in the community is rich, so feel free to talk to others because it's a win-win situation.

You can also invite other people to visit your profile because they might need referral codes or links that only you can offer.

## **Adding New Programs**

One of the ways to gain visibility on your profile and posts is by earning coins. [Adding new programs and revising current ones](https://next.invitation.codes/mag/how-to-submit) are one way of obtaining them. Basically, the more coins you have, the more chances that your visibility increases. As you read in the previous section, if others don't have codes or links to various referrals, you might be the first one to offer them. Moderators are always looking at the authenticity of referral deals, so it's a guaranteed that you can also avoid scams. At the same time, adding programs increases the chances of gaining more referrals.

The more programs you put into the system and once they are verified to work, people would more likely rely on you for new ones, depending on what products or services you use.

## **Helping Other People in the Community**

There are lots of new and current members that have everyday concerns when active on Invitation. If you're the type who learns fast, what you know may help others and in turn, they will always visit your profile and message you if they need help. You're not just helping your fellow users, you're doing a great help for the support team too. Other than technical questions within the website, some members might also need help when it comes to various information about the programs. There are those who like to try something new and would definitely need guidance. If they happen to be within your specialization or niche, it's an opportunity to engage in discussion, giving you credibility and visibility for your profile.

Integrity and dedication goes far. The more you help people, the more that your influence grows. Invitation grows every day, and it's always an opportunity for us to take everyone in this continuous growth!

## **Upgrading to Pro Plans**

This step guarantees you more visibility. The current available plans are the Turbo and Supersonic plans (with more plans launching in the future). Turbo, for example, gives you 5 monthly reposts and a verified badge. Take note, credibility is a factor in growing your visibility, and what better way to prove your credibility than a verified badge? The Supersonic on the other hand provides you more value because aside from 20 monthly reposts that you can get, you will also have advance stats. So, more people will see your profile which potentially converts to more post views and referrals.
