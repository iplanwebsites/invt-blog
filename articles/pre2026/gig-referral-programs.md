The gig economy is here to stay and help a number of people supplement their income. Referring qualified new ride-share drivers or Airbnb hosts have some of the biggest payouts. You are basically referring an employee which is invaluable for the platforms, and they'll reward you generously.

### **Huge gig bonuses**

For example, referring an Airbnb host will earn you 8 times the amount you'd make referring guests to the platform. If you're only promoting a few programs, these offer great rewards! These platforms can be lucrative if you have the time to give them a try!
