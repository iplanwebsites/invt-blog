As we always like to say, everyone is an influencer with Invitation. Today’s feature that we’ll talk about is one of the most exciting ones that we’ve been planning for a long time. We’re proud to introduce “Shops”!

## **How does it work?**

It's the possibility to promote brands on your profile. Any brands. If they don't have a referral program, but sponsor you in other ways, you'll be able to promote them on your profile (i.e. Red Bull for a skateboarder). But the cool thing about it is that Invitation works with hundreds of brands to negotiate influencer deals, so you can earn by promoting them, even if they don't have a referral program.

## **What’s next?**

Stay tuned as we grant access to more users. There are no qualifications to make use of this feature. You don’t need to have a large following or an insta-perfect body. Everyone can promote brands that they like and shops they frequently use. Shops will make your profile look more professional. People will see what brands are associated with you.

With Shops, Invitation aims to simplify everything around affiliate and referral marketing. You’ll basically be able to earn rewards with all kinds of brands, when you and your audience shop, even if these brands don’t have an existing referral program.
