## **Can I buy Invitation coins?**

No. Coins can't be purchased, sold or transferred. Members earn them for their various community contributions.

## **How can I earn coins?**

Inviting friends to invitation is currently the easiest way to receive coins.

You'll also earn coin rewards for completing your profile, hitting some traffic milestones, and posting some special products.

## **Credits â†’ Coins âœ¨**

In a previous version of the app, we awarded credits in place of coins.

It was possible to convert those credits to get a decent discount on the pro plans, but many members didn't have the budget or desire to upgrade to a paid plan. Coins is a more useful reward to the vast majority of our users.

If you had credits in your account, they have been converted to coins (1:1) and can now be used to boost your posts' visibility.

If you were waiting to upgrade to a pro plan with your credits, message&nbsp;[@support](/@support)&nbsp;before March 15, and we'll provide you with a discount code to upgrade (up to 90% off plan prices).

## **Repost quotas**

Everyone can repost at least one of their post each month. Users on premium plans can repost up to 20 posts for free each month.

On top of the monthly repost quotas, coins can now be used to repost more often ðŸ™Œ
