### **What are we looking for?**

**Insights based around a topic that's relevant for our audience**. Your topic must be relevant and targeted toward our audience of mini-influencers, crypto early-adopters and people who want to earn online. We accept articles covering the following topics: ideas to earn online, review of referral programs, simple how-to guides on various topics, honest reviews of platforms to earn online, creative ways to save, passive income, financial autonomy (FIRE), small investments, the value of generosity and community (for the philosophers).

**Your post is 100% original**. We're looking for original content, which means that your article hasn't been published anywhere else. Once your article is live on our site, you can republish it on your own blog or other websites, along with a disclaimer that the article first appeared on the Invitation blog and a backlink to the Invitation URL.

**Your article contains fresh ideas**. As an Invitation guest contributor, you know the latest trends, you have valuable ideas to share, and you know which reputable sources to link to. You can build on ideas from other articles, as long as you don't plagiarize.

**You're up-to-date with blogging best practices.**&nbsp;You're a tried and tested copywriter who knows the ins-and-outs of blogging. Furthermore, you know how to build up your story, how to illustrate your thoughts with images or video, and how to captivate your readers until the end of the last sentence.

### **What's in it for you?**

Your article will be shared with an audience of more than 200,000 monthly visitors across all channels.

You can add 1 non-commercial do-follow link to your business or personal website as a backlink for SEO purposes.

You can link to 3 of your posts in the content.

We make sure our guest contributors receive recognition and followers for their work and have an author bio or profile card for every article. If you've written multiple times for us, you can become a resident writer for the Invitation Blog.

Our users aren't afraid to promote products they love, they are vocal ambassadors.

You're not alone. Our marketing team is here to help you along the way, so you aren't flying solo. They help to ensure your article really hits the mark and fits perfectly within the Invitation brand
