We're a tiny team, striving to provide a free and rewarding experience to thousands of people every day.

If you have a question, please take a minute to review the FAQ below.

### **I need a code for _______**

Okay! Try searching the site for the code you need. We currently have coupons and invites for 2,000+ sites and the list is growing daily. If you can't find it, try asking in the community discussion or on our Facebook group.

### **Do I need a Google account to sign up?**

Yes. We know it's not ideal, but signing in with a Google account helps us keep the community fair and spam-free. If you'd like to use a non-Gmail email address for your account, you can register that email as a new Google account and use it to sign up here.

### **Can I change my @username?**

You can only set it once. Choose wisely.

### **How can I post a code for X?**

Search the site for this product; chances are your referral program is already listed on the site. On the product page you'll have the option to add your code.

### **How can I add a referral program that isn't listed?**

You can post your code and submit a new page for that referral program here. Every contribution is reviewed manually, so please allow some time for your content to become visible. Quality contributions (and contributors) are reviewed in priority. Submitting new programs lets you climb the contributor leaderboard and gives you lifetime extra visibility for that product.

### **Why are my codes not showing on the list?**

First, make sure your code is valid. If you just posted it, it's almost guaranteed to show up on everyone's list. As new members also share their code for that same product, chances of your code appearing on the lists slowly decrease.

### **How can I get more visibility on the platform?**

There are many ways. Being a helpful & active community member will help you build a good following. Members who spread the word about Invitation will also get more organic visibility. Reposting your codes put them back at the top of the list. To keep it fair for everyone and prevent abuses, members on the free plan can only repost 1 code per month. Premium members can repost their codes a bit more often, but there is no one who can buy traffic. You're responsible to promote your content. We're just providing you tools to help out a bit. :)

### **How can I earn Invitation coins?**

When you're active on the platform and introduce friends to Invitation, you can earn platform coins. The list of available and earned rewards are in your profile.

### **Where are my old credits?**

They got converted to the new invitation coins to let your repost your offers without the need to upgrade to a premium plan.

### **Can withdrawal or transfer my coins?**

No. For now, your in-app invitation coins can only be spent toward reposts.

### **I found a code that doesn't work**

You can use the report button on the code page. Community feedback helps us keep only fresh and valid codes on the lists.

### **I found a bug**

Our developers love bugs! Tell us about it please. It'd be great if you can include screenshots and some context about how you encountered the problem.

### **I'd love to have X feature**

We have an ambitious roadmap and new features monthly. Please tell us how we could make this product more useful to you.

### **How can I know who (and how many people) uses my codes?**

Your performance (stats) page shows you detailed traffic reports for all your codes. When someone uses one of your code, the referring company will email you confirming the referral. When you use another member's code, it's a nice gesture to shoot them a message to thank them. It will also help you reach out to the company if they aren't honoring the referral reward.

### **I submitted a new referral program and don't see my code.**

We review all new submissions manually to make sure they're legit and valuable referral program to everyone. That new product might first appear on your profile before being listed on all public pages. Thanks for your patience and feel free to contact us if your product haven't been approved after a few days (it's a lot of work to keep up with everyone suggestions!).

### **How do I apply my credits to a pro plan?**

When you're ready for an upgrade, contact @support, we'll review your credits to make sure everything is legit, and you'll get a coupon to apply your credits at checkout.

### **Can I get a refund?**

Sure thing! In the unlikely case you're not happy with your premium plan, we offer 30 days money-back guarantee.

### **How Do I disable my account?**

You can&nbsp;[disable your account here](/profile/deletemyaccount), and none of your content will be visible by anyone. This is a pretty permanent decision, and you may not be able to reuse that email or make the same posts again. In all cases, we're here to help, just tell us about your situation. Contact @support and if you have any questions.

### **Is this a micro-task website?**

Since Invitation.codes is often included in lists of clever ways to earn online (like micro-task websites) it might confuse some users. Invitation is a free app and Chrome extension where people can find and share referral codes. It helps you earn referral rewards with referral programs (like Airbnb or Coinbase), but it's not a micro-task website. It's like a mini homepage for all your codes, and you get some extra exposure from the community. Furthermore, it doesn't pay you anything directly (at least for now). If you'd like to purchase a pro plan, it's possible to secure a discount by inviting friends. It's our own referral program, and not some sort of pyramidal money-making scheme that will get you rich quick.
