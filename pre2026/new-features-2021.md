Your favorite site for collecting and posting referral codes/links, made faster, stronger and friendlier! We’re happy that you joined us in a roller coaster journey this early. As we grow with you, Invitation aims to provide you value and perks the more you stay with us! We made this fun article to get you more excited of what’s in store for you, for us, and for every friend that we will make together.

Nothing is more good news than your favorite app, service, or website getting improved for your convenience. Of course, we won’t fall behind either. Here’s what to expect for the future of Invitation as a loyal member:

Discussion will be central

Better inbox&nbsp;

Nicer profile&nbsp;

Tons of programs

Faster loading and navigation times

More mobile friendly

There are tons of new features to talk about. In this article we highlight these 6 important (and incredibly convenient) ones!

## **🆕 Discussion will be central 📢**

Who doesn’t like a page where all discussions are in one place? It's hard to get accurate answers about referral programs, and it often feels like spam to post about them on other social networks. Talk about the latest promos, programs and any stuff under the sun with other members (who’ll most likely will be your new friends) using a new discussion page! At Invitation, we aim to move not only forward, but also closer together.

Once the new site launches, you’ll never have to open that extra tab to discuss in the community. We created a place to exchange and discuss, because talking to other people should always be simple. We aim to bring every feature, all in one website! There’s nothing more convenient than that. 😉

## **🆕 Better inbox 💬**

While we had a basic inbox for a while, it wasn't the easiest to use for conversations. We’re a referral directory, but we want to provide you some easy convenient perks too. Connecting with one another in PM was quite useful to most of the members, so we wanted this experience to be as smooth as sending a wink emoji to your crush on IG.

We’re actually happy that we were able to build a simple inbox for you guys. What we plan with the new website is to improve the inbox with 2 goals: make it simple and smooth.

## **🆕 Nicer profile 😎**

Your profile shouldn’t just be a pile of your referral codes. A sleek and on-fleek look is the way to go! With a nicer profile in place, get ready to look more professional and stunning! If you’re planning to go on a pro plan, it’s better to save up and avail as early as now too, more perks await for those on the pro plans!

Your referral codes, best picture, one-liner bio (or icebreaker), and social links all in a stylish page. Never miss the opportunity to look your best (especially for your friends and your crush)!

## **🆕 Tons of programs 🖥️**

Referral programs are always being updated on Invitation. It’s literally one of the main reasons people stay on the website. It is safe (and exciting) to say that referral programs, even though small, have a strong power to bring all of us together.

As Invitation dreams to grow, we also dream to provide everyone more options to engage on, meaning, more referral programs that you can join to! Imagine more opportunities to earn extra from referral programs that Invitation carefully reviews.

## **🆕 Faster loading and navigation times 🏎️**

The main highlight of the new site is to provide everyone a more convenient experience in terms of using it. Most members talk to support, and we definitely hear you! All the feedback that we get suggests a smoother experience, and we agree. That’s why once the new site launches, you can count on us that a reliable navigation and faster loading times are what we aim to offer!

Checking the latest discussions should be easy, going to your referral codes on your profile should be quick, and reading your message should be a click away. With the new site, we are diligently working to bring it to you as a package!

## **🆕 More mobile friendly 📱**

A lot of people ask us to have a mobile version or an app. As we progress closer to the new site, you can expect that accessing Invitation on your phone is just like accessing it on your laptop, smooth and fun! On the new site, Invitation aims to bring a mobile friendly UI, so you could access your codes, profile and inbox at the palm of your hand.

There's so much to expect as the launch of the new site draws near. That's why if you're reading this, we're happy to announce that we're excited to have you as one of the beta-testers of the new Invitation platform. In other words, we're giving select members early access to Invitation's new site! The features we talked about in this article will be available to early users (with some Easter eggs and surprises), so explore at your own risk.

As you explore and navigate through the new site, we're very open and would love to hear what you have to say. That's why you can also submit your thoughts and suggestions to Invitation's [feedback form](https://next.invitation.codes/mag/feedback). Any thoughts or ideas are highly welcomed. Just take note that it's better to fill out the feedback form using the desktop site instead of accessing it through your mobile device, as it might be a bit buggy for the mobile version.

We’re very excited to work on these features and bring them to you as soon as possible. As we always say to members who chat with support, we are really overwhelmed by the community growth! Thank you for your continuous support, guys. We would never reach this milestone with your overwhelming loyalty and love for Invitation. Keep bringing the feedback and suggestions, we always love them!

We're just getting started, thanks for being an early adopter and supporting our indie platform!
