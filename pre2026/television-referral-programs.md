Watching your favorite show is a great way to pass the time. You wouldn't actually notice how much time has passed if you're watching a show with great plot. Businesses have made it possible to earn revenue from television apps and sites.

### **Watch more shows**

The reason why some companies grow, is that they have shows that air exclusively on their app or website. Fans would then be willing to pay for a subscription just to know what happens within the plot of these various shows. From one famous platform to newly created ones, there's so many options for you to choose from when finding your favorite series or movies.

### **Save and earn while watching**

These television apps and sites were able to take user retention further. If you can invite a friend over, most of these apps and sites offer a free one month premium. Other bonuses include credits that you can use towards your next bill. Referral programs are really a great marketing strategy for these companies. Check this list we compiled to see where you can watch more shows!
