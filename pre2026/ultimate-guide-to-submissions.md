You might be wondering why Invitation has one of the largest databases for referral programs that you’ll find on the internet. With more than 5,000 referral programs to choose from, you can say that we might have the biggest list out there.

We’re not taking all the credit though. This is because of you guys, and we thank everyone for this milestone. Thousands of users have contributed new programs to find daily. Along with new referral programs, description edits are also submitted that keep the current ones up to date.

This current database. that is available for free, doesn’t stop here. We as a team aim to have more referral programs listed on the Invitation platform and we know that we’re not in this alone.&nbsp;

For new users, you might be wondering how to submit a new referral program. For active members, you might be thinking about how you can make your submissions better. Today, we’re making this guide so we can both move forward as an active referral community.&nbsp;

We always approve new entries and we thought, improving the quality of descriptions would help more people. So, we’ll take note first of the two most important pages you’ll need when submitting a new referral program.

The referral programs’ list ([https://next.invitation.codes/programs](https://next.invitation.codes/programs))

The submission page ([https://next.invitation.codes/new-referral-program](https://next.invitation.codes/new-referral-program))

Before submitting a new entry, it’s important to look at the current list. You should ask yourself, is the site that I’m adding already on Invitation? By using the list, you can quickly search if an app or site is already listed on Invitation.

Have you checked the availability? If it’s not yet listed, we’ll go deeper and discuss the submissions page. We’re going to make your entries more fun and helpful for other users on the website.

### Suggesting a new referral program

This would be the heart of today’s discussion. You might be aware of what are the details you enter on the submission page, but you can actually make them better. We’ll discuss each detail of the page that shows the info for a referral program.

### Basic details

Starting off with the “Name of this site/app”, it’s important to consider how they brand themselves. It makes it more recognizable to others. For example, “TikTok” has both of the Ts capitalized rather than only the starting letter. If you’re submitting your own app or site, you wouldn’t want it to be misspelled or misrepresented.

In our experience, “Company URL” is often mistaken for other links. Some users put their own referral link instead of the app/site’s base link. Unfortunately, we have to remove the personalized links to make it fair for everyone. Don’t worry, you’ll appear on the page as the contributor if you’re the first to submit the new app or site!

Category on the other hand makes it easier for the referral program to be searched. Some categories might overlap, but the closest category would help other people more. For example, Binance can be both in “Crypto” and “Financial”, but we all know that it’s leaning more towards crypto.

### Product description

This would be one of the most important details in a newly submitted entry. We advise not to be like Wikipedia when typing the description of a product or an app. While it’s important that the description is neutral, you can make it sound personalized.&nbsp;

For instance, Walmart could be written as an American multinational retail corporation of grocery chains, but that would sound too formal. Instead, you can write that Walmart makes shopping easier with everyday low prices! It’s friendlier right?

Try it out when you submit a new program. Don’t worry, we’re always available to review and improve product descriptions. From the earlier example, you’ll also notice we don’t use pronouns. It’s better to write descriptions in the third-person POV rather than first-person.

Here’s a quick tip, keywords would make descriptions easier to read. For Walmart, you can put words like “supermarket”, “grocery”, and “shopping”.

### Referral program details

You don’t have to worry about the accuracy of existing referral programs listed on Invitation. We make sure to verify the information submitted by everyone. Sometimes, we even contribute entries ourselves that are well-researched. You can also do the same.

First, you can talk about what the referral program is about. Does it use a link or code? Write about the benefits given to the referrer and to the referral too. Another important detail in this section is the action required by the referral to get the sign-up bonus.

There are so many users on Invitation who joined to look for sign-up bonuses. That’s why you need to include each step required so that they can easily get them. This also benefits you, because if they do sign-up, you get the referral bonus.

### The “Where to find” section

Most of the time, people also want to share their own referral link or code to the app/site you’ve added. This section would help them find their own link when they’re on the platform that you’re submitting. You can put steps on how to get their own link, then add a URL of that particular page where their referral link can be taken.

Last but not the least, there’s a section where you can put notes for us too. If you want to request some special edits to your submission, we can do our best to have it done when we review your submission.&nbsp;

Now that you’ve done your part in Invitation’s active community, we’ll guarantee you that your submission would look great as a newly listed page on the website. You’ll even find your username in the “Contributed by” section!&nbsp;
