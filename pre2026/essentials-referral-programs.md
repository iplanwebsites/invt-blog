As vaccines are being distributed around the world, it is still important to have various essentials in stock. As the famous saying goes, prevention is always better than cure. Essentials are not limited to people, as there are essential products that maintain your home.

### **Stay prepared**

Always be ready to have essential products at home. Depending on the country, you'll never know when a lockdown can be imposed. To clarify, just stock some, not hoard them, so that others could have them too. It's easy to purchase essentials nowadays since they have apps and sites which serve as online stores.

### **Reap benefits as you stock**

These essential apps and sites have referral programs. You can get rewards such as credits towards your next purchase, discounts, and free items just by inviting someone to buy or sign up. Help others stock by inviting them, and get rewarded for a good deed! Use a referral code from our collection of brands that have generous referrals.
